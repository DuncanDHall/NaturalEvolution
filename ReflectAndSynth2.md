# Reflections and Synthesis-Review 2

### Reflection and Decisions

We mostly asked for ideas on where we should go in the last few days. There are many different ways to go, many of which are very interesting; however, in the time we have, we cannot implement everything. We wanted to see what others wanted to see from our project. We first asked them if we should implement some sort of user interface, more than just the constants in the ‘constants.py’ file. Many of the responses we received were to build a very simple interface, such as a command line interface or keyboard commands. We will probably go with the keyboard commands, since we have already implemented those. It would just be a matter of letting the user know. We also asked what kind of metrics they would like to see beyond just the simulation, and they told us they wanted to see and they said they wanted the simulation to better reflect the current state of the population, like highlighting the winners and making the Blob sizes actually reflect the Blob’s state or attributes.

We also asked them what kind of interactions they wanted to see implemented into the simulation. We were expecting very specific answers about how the Blobs would react to each other, and many of the answers did address that, such as how nice Blobs could share energy when they intersect to help the weak and Blobs that will eat other Blobs. We got lots of other answers too, like making different food values or having foods with different nutrients. People also suggested making the sight more like a sense of smell, closer to how actual bacteria and amoeba behave. Finally people suggested changing the environment, such as putting in a maze and seeing how the Blobs find food. Changing the environment was something we hadn’t thought about, and is very fascinating to us.


### Review Process Reflection

This technical review went a lot better than the last one. After the last technical review, we decided that getting help on algorithms required an audience that was much more well versed in that field, such as a team of students that had already taken FOCS. As a result, we decided to focus more on high level aspects--what do people want our program to look like and what would people find interesting? We came up with two very open ended questions, one on the visuals of the program, and one on the behavior of the Blobs. The structure of our presentation went similarly to what we expected, but we got lots of interesting feedback out of it. Allowing people to write down their thoughts on sticky notes was also good. Even though we had a good conversation, many of the ideas on the sticky notes were not said out loud, and they give a better perspective on the ideas of the less vocal members of our group. Overall this was a very effective technical review, it would just be difficult to modify this system for questions that are less open ended.


### Next steps:
Create the ability for Blobs to see other Blobs
Work on the mutation process a little
Make the GUI a little more user friendly (ex. What are the different sizes of Blobs, what are the keyboard commands)
Look into changing the attributes of the food
If there is time, look into changing the environment, giving Blobs the ability to eat other Blobs.
