####  Description:
Natural Evolution is a simulation of a natural selection and speciation, using genetic algorithms and neural networks.  It shows the evolution of organisms that eat food and reproduce “at will” (through neural networks).

The simulation is run on Pygame, and the organisms make decisions using neural networks.
To change the behavior of the simulation, change the constants in 'constants.py' .

#### Dependencies
* Python 2.7
* Pygame 1.9.1 – [get it](http://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted)
* Numpy 1.10.4 – [get it](http://www.scipy.org/scipylib/download.html)

#### How To Use
From terminal:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/DuncanDHall/NaturalEvolution.git
```
```
$ python main.py 
```
At this point, a PyGame window should appear displaying 10 white "blobs" and one orange "food", which begin interacting. Pressing space stops the program and closes the window.
