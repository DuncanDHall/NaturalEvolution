# NaturalEvolution

Team Members:
    Serena Chen, Duncan Hall, David Papp, and Nathan Yee

Primary Objective:
    Create a program which simulates a sumplified process of evolution including natural selection and reproduction.

Stretch Goals:
    - Investigate social interactions between population members, and how environmental factors can shape interactions.
    - Balance environment to foster division into different families with different behaviors. e.x. mosquito-like with lots of unfit offspring, and elephant-like with few higher-fitness offspring. Also predators vs. prey.
    - Find symbiotic behavior?
