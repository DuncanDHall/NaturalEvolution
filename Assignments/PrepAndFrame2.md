# Natural Genetics

### Background and Context

After being introduced to evolutionary algorithms with the SoftDes toolboxes, our group’s goal is to implement a simulation where artificial selection is no longer necessary, as agents reproduce, mutate, and die by themselves, mimicking a form of natural selection. We are creating a self-selecting population of individuals (‘Blobs,’ if you will) that have a certain amount of energy that runs out over time and can be replenished by picking up food. These Blobs will make decisions using Neural Networks, and when a generation dies out, the highest scoring individuals will start the next generation. We wish to implement more complex systems after making a successful program that evolves Blobs to get food, such as obstacle or social structures.

### Key Questions

We will address two design decisions. The first one is deciding what kind of interactions the Blobs should have with each other. We’ve been thinking about the different ways the Blobs could react when they intersect other Blobs, and we want to see what others think.

The second question is if there should be some kind of user interface. Our group wasn’t really set on having a user interface; we wanted it to be more of a simulation. However, many people in our presenting group seemed to want a sort of game, so we want to see their thoughts on what exactly they want to see, and we will see if their ideas complement with our personal goals in the project.


### Agenda for Technical Review

We will begin by introducing our program and our objective to the group, and showing a short video of our current implementation (0:00 - 2:00). We will describe the progress we’ve made and the neural network algorithms we’ve implemented. 
In our first round of questions, we will ask our audience what type of behavior they would like to see implemented. We will have sticky notes, and people can feel free to write their ideas, but there will be no brainstorming period. We will allocate 10 minutes to this discussion.
The second round of questions will be regarding what kind of user interface the audience would like to see implemented. We will give this 10 minutes and use the same method as we did for the previous question.
