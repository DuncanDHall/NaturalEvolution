# Reflections and Synthesis-Review 1

### Reflection and Decisions

Many people suggested that we create a game. People may have been biased by how we framed the questions (Making the only explicit suggestion for a more compelling project be a game). Nevertheless, it is interesting to see that people want to see more user interaction. At the least, we hope to make a custom menu where users can play with the initial conditions.

There was also popular sentiment that dictionaries with keys linking to behaviors would be a strong way to implement what we’re trying to do. However, we don’t want to have to dictate every possible behavior. The group has concluded that dictionaries do not allow the flexibility or permissibility required to achieve rich and interesting behavior. Instead, we are opting to explore whether or not we can create rich and interesting behavior through a classifications of basic decisions such as accelerate, decelerate, turn left, and turn right. We want to allows blobs to develop their own complicated behaviors implicit to the patterns in their DNA (just as with reading real-world DNA, As, Ts, Cs, and Gs have been around for quite a while, but new behaviors are produced frequently).

### Review Process Reflection

We intentionally did not provide much context prior to asking our audience questions. Our intention with this was to encourage the audience to create their own ideas rather than build off of what we present. In retrospect, it might have been more successful to provide context first, because there was a lot of confusion around the questions we asked. The answers we received were general and did not reflect what we wanted to achieve with this technical review and in our project. In the future, we should assign some pre-reading and really make explicit what our goals are for the project and what kind of feedback and solutions we are looking for.

We also had two very different questions, and as a result, we were unable to give adequate time to give the background information and discuss feedback during our presentation. Although we want to minimize the time we spend talking about what we have already done, we should create more realistic agendas that allow for more quality feedback.

While creating the presentation, we had a long discussion about what direction we all wanted to take this project, and we didn’t end up coming to complete agreement. This made our presentation a little less focused than we all would have liked, but we’re in the process of getting back on the same page.

When re-reading our post-its, we realized it would have been a good idea to give more direction with our prompts. As we presented it, we ended up with ideas which were outside of the range of directions we wanted to consider taking our project. So for the future: we should use stickies when we’re looking for a wide range of ideas.

### Next steps:
* Continue exploring how to encode DNA for creatures. We were given a lot ideas as to how achieve rich creature behavior.  We need to make decisions regarding whether we want to explore neural networks or other DNA implementations. This will probably mean looking at actual implementations of neural networks very soon.
* Check out Creature Docking Station, see what is applicable
* Continue exploring how to mutate DNA.  Like the DNA, people brought up different ways achieving interesting DNA mutation.  We want to explore neuroevolution of augmenting topologies (NEAT), and mathematical functions for other implementations.  Most of the feedback was about user driven mutations, this would be more applicable if we wanted to make a game.
* Design work: there is some interest about user input.  This largely depends on what kind of simulation we can make, but this is a potential area we can explore.  For example, we could have user created terrain in attempt to find interesting speciation.
* Compelling problem/species: speciation in different environments, invasive species, fight against “boss” (user designed boss?), cannibalism, social behavior


### Deltas for future reviews:
* Start presentation with a brief agenda
* Assign homework so people can understand the difference between Natural and Artificial selection
* Consider group discussions Vs. post it notes. Use post it notes only when you want to gather ideas in many directions. Also with more directed prompts.
