<p> We utilize neural networks and genetic algorithms to simulate the population.</p>

<p>Our game has the following dependencies: <br>
Python 2.7 <br>
Pygame 1.9.1 – get it <br>
Numpy 1.10.4 – get it <br>
To install our simulation game, run the following command in terminal:<br>
$ git clone https://github.com/DuncanDHall/NaturalEvolution.git<br>


$ python main.py<br>
At this point, a PyGame window should appear displaying 10 white "blobs" and one orange "food", which begin interacting. Pressing space stops the program and closes the window.</p>

<a id="creating-pages-manually" class="anchor" href="#creating-pages-manually" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Implementation</h3>

<p>Each blob is an object with the following attributes: angle of sight, radius of sight, distance to food, angle to food, and energy left to live. <br>
We implemented a neural network that pictured (here) that essentially takes the weighted average of the distance to food and angle to food to calculate the angle and speed at which the blob moves. The weights are simply constants that are genetically evolved.
With each generation, </p>

<p>Prior to learning about neural networks, we created .
<br> The final milestone in our project was implementing natural selection over artificial selection. In the first stages of our project, we would evaluate the fitness of each blob in the generation according to a formula we devised based on food. We then took the two most fit blobs and averaged their features while randomizing it to a certain percentage. This process is called artificial selection, and it was one of our original goals to move past this. <br>
We switched to natural selection by assigning each blob an energy attribute that would decrease as the blob moved or waited, which essentially simulates metabolism in real organisms. If a blob runs out of energy, it dies. However, rather than taking the two most fit blobs at the end of each generation and combining their genes to produce the new generation, blobs would reproduce when they bumped into each other. This mimics natural reproduction and it introduces the need for a whole different style of behavior. </p>
